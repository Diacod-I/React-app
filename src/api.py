#api.py is an attempt of me trying to figure out how to
#make a python flask API without documention access or YouTube
#guidance, since I have no internet due to the Michaung Cyclone
#(Im gonna miserably fail, but Ill try and learn)

"""Approach 1: Access pip via the project terminal
    Result: Miserably failed since pip aint recognised by
    npm controlled terminal, dumbass.
